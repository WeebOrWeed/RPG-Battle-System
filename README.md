I finished the development of this project in about 4 hours. And I think many of the experiences I had are both fun and challenging.

***Q1(10-15 mintues)***

This part is basically follow the instruction and create the player script for our user, with enum classes for actions.

***Q2(1 hour)***

I personally found this part more challenging than part 3 as this is the part that requires most design from our standpoint rather than just following instructions. I decided it to be a card battle game to better track the turns, with all information about the character being shown around the card. I did not have enough time for this but I would defintely improve the UI to be more readable if I have the time.

I also found it convinient to use GenAI to create art assets fast and they are really helpful in debugging too as they separate different minions relatively easily.

***Q3(1 hour)***

This part of the challenge is really fun but also have to take care of the design of telling the users to see what is happening right now. And I decided to use animators to show popups about actions and responses. While the long term-effects are controlled directed by setting active/inactive through code. To make it more clear, I also draw a line between the two interacting opponents to see who is influencing who, with the red end representing the initiating end, and the white end representing the recieving end.

***Q4(~2 hours)***

I would say desigining the whole program is not hard, but putting them together and making the software run smooth requires extra care and extensive logging to pinpoint the situation. This primarily debugging on smaller issues like handling Null pointer errors when a team is eliminated but we still try to get a random player. I would not eloborate on these minmaxing.
